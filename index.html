		<p>Willy the worm is a common earthworm born in the inner city Melbourne suburb of Parkville. Unsurprisingly, he lives in the earth and eats dirt and scraps to survive. This might sound like an unpleasant life to the human reading this, but to Willy and others of his kind, this is literally the ideal way to be.</p>
